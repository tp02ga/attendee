# What is a bot?

In the Attendee platform, a bot is an automated participant that can join virtual meetings across different platforms (Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams) to perform various tasks such as recording and transcription.

# Bot Capabilities

2. Joining: Bot is attempting to join meeting
3. Joined - Not Recording: Bot has joined but isn't recording

5. Leaving: Bot is leaving the meeting
6. Post Processing: Bot is processing recordings
7. Fatal Error: Bot encountered an unrecoverable error
8. Waiting Room: Bot is in meeting's waiting room
9. Ended: Bot has completed all tasks and recordings are available for download
